                <p class="small-big">Welcome to motivationbeats.com, a website dedicated to self improvement with a focus on personal productivity, motivation, and self education.
                    Although the site covers a wide range of topics.<br/>

                    1. Time is our most precious resource. Managing it effectively is essential for an excellent life.<br/>
                    2. Motivation – We only get as far as we can push ourselves. This site will help you overcome mental blocks and motivate yourself to act.<br/>
                    3. Self Education – Learning shouldn’t end after graduation. Rather than focusing on academics, this site covers the most valuable education — the one you give yourself each and every day.<br/>
